Hunspell Dictionaries
=====================

Castellanohablantes: [https://github.com/ks7000/hs-dict/Leeme.md]

This repository provides dictionary data for the spell checker *Hunspell*. Each language is separated into its own branch, where each is directly based on the `anchor` branch, plus they are all merged together in `master`. The spell checker itself is *not* included, but available at http://hunspell.sourceforge.net.

If you would like to add another dictionary for e.g. a *new* language `zz` and country `ZZ`, then apply:

    $ git checkout anchor
    $ git checkout -b zz
    $ git add zz_ZZ.aff
    $ git add zz_ZZ.dic
    $ git commit -m "New dictionary: zz"
    $ git push --set-upstream origin zz
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge zz

Otherwise, if the language branch `zz` already exists, then:

    $ git checkout zz
    $ git add zz_ZZ.aff
    $ git add zz_ZZ.dic
    $ git commit -m "New dictionary: zz"
    $ git push --set-upstream origin zz
    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge zz

This sequence of commands will make sure, that the history of the repository remains clean, and it enables access to each dictionary separately. Consider a *pull request* if you think your dictionary data is of high quality and might be of use for others.
